# Art Dealer

## Description
<!-- [Provide a brief description of the game, including its objective, gameplay mechanics, and any unique features.] -->
 Art Dealer is a card-based game, written in Java by Dustin Yochim, Ellis Twiggs Jr, Jonathan Schweighauser, Adam Loepker, and Yosef Alqufidi in the Spring 2024 Semester as part of the Introduction to Software Profession class at the University of Missouri - Saint
 Louis.

 ## Iterations
### Homework 1
 The program lets you deal out 4 cards and then will show you your hand, and log your hand in a separate file, you can continue to draw cards or quit the program.

 ### Homework 2
 Now the program lets you pick your cards, rather than the cards being randomly dealt to you. This iteration also adds the history of your previous hands to the display on the game screen.
